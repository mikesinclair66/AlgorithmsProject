; Script 1
;
; Testing using a small dataset
;
; Specify boundaries of coordinate space:
;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
World boundaries are set to:
	383000
    794530	792630
	381000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Import the dataset [the address here is a relative address]
Imported ./VA_Monterey.txt into local storage.
;
; Lets visualize our already imported geographical data
;
; Also lets see what is inside name and coordinate indices
;
; To fill out the cache, let's do a single-match location search
;
; Now lets see if our cache is filled up
;
; A few more search queries
; oops Church is "FEATURE_CLASS" how about the following query?
; Let's try a wrong state abbreviation
;
; Lets check the buffer pool again
;
; So lets check the LRU mechanism [this query should move the last element of the cache all the way to the front!]
;
; checking the buffer pool again
;
; More location searches
; We expect two location matches for this one
;
; Now performing some area search [this should return 7 features]
;
; checking the buffer pool again
; how about querying somewhere outside boundaries ?
; Let's try some variations of a single-match region search with a square region:
; Let's try increasing the size of the region:
;
; Let's import a larger dataset [wait a second, VA_Bath has 520 records, why didn't all of them get imported? explain this in your report]
Imported ./VA_Bath.txt into local storage.
; as import command bypasses the buffer pool, content of the buffer pool should remain intact
